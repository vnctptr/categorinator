NOTE
from `langdetect` https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/

Language detection algorithm is non-deterministic, which means that if you try to run it on a text which is either too short or too ambiguous, you might get different results everytime you run it.

To enforce consistent results, call following code before the first language detection:

```
from langdetect import DetectorFactory
DetectorFactory.seed = 0
```

To add to readme:

- Python version: 3.9.7
